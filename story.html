                Ah yes.. The story of <b>Amy</b> and <b>Ryan</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                How is it that two young <b>Googlers</b> find themselves creating such a site as this?
                Is it a scandal?
                Where was <b>HR</b>?!?!
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="solid-pane">
            <p>
                It all began in <b>2021</b>.
                Amy was a Software Engineer engineering lots of software for the <b>"Chrome Toolchains"</b> team when Ryan
                joined the nearby <b>"ChromeOS Toolchains"</b> team.
                Despite the similar names, these were not technically the same team, but they sat in the same corner
                of Google's <b>Sunnyvale</b> office.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was when working from the office was optional due to covid measures and not very many people were coming in,
                but Amy and Ryan came in frequently and would often get lunch together with a handful of other teammates.
                Though they didn't tell each other this at the time, both Amy and Ryan would go to the office for lunch nearly every day
                in part driven by the hope that the other one would be there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soon, in addition to lunch in the office, their friendship expanded to include climbing at the local climbing gym.
            </p>

        <br>
        <div class="solid-pane">
            <p>
                Ryan pretty much had a crush on Amy from day one, but he didn't know if he should say it.
                Eventually though their friendship developed further when they started going on hikes together
                and climbing outdoors.

        <div class="solid-pane">
            <p>
                Finally, in February 2022, Ryan decided to test his luck and invited Amy to join him on a snowshoe backpacking trip up El Capitan in Yosemite.
                She was excited to join and they had a great time hiking through the snow and setting up camp.

                Though that weekend they were still just friends,
                they would begin dating within the very same week.
                And more adventures were soon to follow...

        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="solid-pane">
            <p>
                In the time that followed, Amy and Ryan have been very happy together
                and their love for each other has continued to grow. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <br>
        <div class="solid-pane">
            <p>
                In the summer of 2024, Ryan began to plan a proposal.
                Several options were considered, but always Ryan was
                drawn to the idea of bringing it back to Yosemite where
                it all began.
            </p>
            <p>
                On August 10th, Amy and Ryan hiked from Tenaya Lake to 
                Clouds Rest. Ryan was unusually nervous.
            </p>

        <br>
        <div class="solid-pane">
            <p>
                The top of that mountain is the most perfect 360-panoramic view Ryan knows of.
                You can look down and see almost all of Yosemite Valley below.
                From there, the (in)famous peak of Half Dome, where Amy and Ryan enjoyed several hard earned meals, can be observed 
                over 1000ft below you, and about 2 miles to the South West.
                To the North East you can see Cathedral Peaks other peaks around which Ryan and Amy have visited while backpacking.
                And on the edge of the horizon, just barely in sight, you can faintly identify the unmistakable surface of El Capitan itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the top of Clouds Rest, Ryan pointed out El Capitan to Amy.
                He told her that at the time when they were up there together, fumbling through the snow and laughing..
                that being there with her had been by far the best thing he had ever done.
                And that's because while they were out there, backpacking together for the first time, Ryan realized without a doubt that
                he was hopelessly in love and that he never wanted his adventure with her to end.
                He wanted it to only be beginning.
                And though years had gone by in between, those two facts remained the same. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So Ryan asked Amy to marry him, and Amy said "Yes" and now they're planning an awesome wedding.
                Building out their website because they want their friends to help them celebrate.
                And speaking of friends and helping celebrate, Ryan had recruited a whole pile of them to surprise Amy on their way down from
                Clouds Rest. The proposal.. well she saw that coming.. but the ambush was a surprise!!

                The rest of their story is tbd. Expect no end to more mountains, more laughing and more love. Beyond that, well.. who knows what happens... but this author is optimistic!
