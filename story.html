                Ah yes.. The story of <b>Amy</b> and <b>Ryan</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                How is it that two young <b>Googlers</b> find themselves creating such a site as this?
                Is it a <b>scandal</b>?
                Where was <b>HR</b> in all of this?!?!
            </p>

            <p>
                It all began in <b>2021</b>.
                <b>Amy</b> was a Software Engineer engineering lots of software for the <b>"Chrome Toolchains"</b> team when <b>Ryan</b>
                joined the nearby <b>"ChromeOS Toolchains"</b> team.
                Despite the similar names, these were not technically the same team, but they sat in the same corner
                of Google's <b>Sunnyvale</b> office.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was when working from the <b>office</b> was optional due to covid measures and not very many people were coming in,
                but <b>Amy</b> and <b>Ryan</b> came in <b>frequently</b> and would often get <b>lunch</b> together with a handful of other teammates.
                Though they didn't tell each other this at the time, both <b>Amy</b> and <b>Ryan</b> would go to the office for lunch nearly every day
                in part driven by the hope that the other one would be there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soon, in addition to <b>lunch</b> in the office, their friendship expanded to include <b>climbing</b> at the local <b>climbing gym</b>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <!-- side by side climbing photos -->
        <br>
        <div class="solid-pane">
            <p>
                <b>Ryan</b> pretty much had a crush on <b>Amy</b> from day one, but he didn't know if he should say it.
                Eventually though their <b>friendship</b> developed further when they started going on <b>hikes</b> together
                and climbing <b>outdoors</b>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="solid-pane">
            <p>
                Finally, in February 2022, <b>Ryan</b> decided to test his luck and invited <b>Amy</b> to join him on a <b>snowshoe</b> backpacking trip up <b>El Capitan</b> in <b>Yosemite</b>.
                She was excited to join and they had a great time <b>hiking</b> through the snow and setting up <b>camp</b>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <!-- El capitan photos-->

        <div class="solid-pane">
            <p>
                Though that <b>weekend</b> they were still just friends,
                they would begin <b>dating</b> within the very same week,
                and more <b>adventures</b> were soon to follow...
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <!-- Various trip pjhotos, half dome, etc.-->
        <br>
        <div class="solid-pane">
            <p>
                In the time that followed, <b>Amy</b> and <b>Ryan</b> have been very <b>happy</b> together
                and their <b>love</b> for each other has continued to grow. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Photo of us looking happy and in love-->

            <p>
                In the <b>summer</b> of 2024, <b>Ryan</b> began to plan a <b>proposal</b>.
                Several options were considered, but always <b>Ryan</b> was
                drawn to the idea of bringing it back to <b>Yosemite</b> where
                it all began.
            </p>
            <p>
                On August 10th, <b>Amy</b> and <b>Ryan</b> hiked from <b>Tenaya Lake</b> to 
                <b>Clouds Rest</b>. <b>Ryan</b> was unusually <b>nervous</b>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <!-- Hiking up clouds rest photo-->
        <br>
        <div class="solid-pane">
            <p>
                The top of that <b>mountain</b> is the most perfect <b>360-panoramic</b> view <b>Ryan</b> knows of.
                You can look down and see almost all of <b>Yosemite Valley</b> below.
                From there, the (in)famous peak of <b>Half Dome</b>, where <b>Amy</b> and <b>Ryan</b> enjoyed several hard earned meals, can be observed 
                over <b>1000 feet</b> below you, and about two miles to the South West.
                To the North East you can see <b>Cathedral Peaks</b> and others around which <b>Ryan</b> and <b>Amy</b> have been backpacking.
                And on the edge of the <b>horizon</b>, just barely in sight, you can faintly identify the <b>unmistakable</b> surface of <b>El Capitan</b> itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the top of Clouds Rest, <b>Ryan</b> pointed out El Capitan to <b>Amy</b>.
                He told her that at the time when they were up there <b>together</b>, fumbling through the snow and laughing..
                that being there with her had been by far the best thing he had ever done.
                And that's because while they were out there, backpacking together for the first time, <b>Ryan</b> realized without a doubt that
                he was hopelessly in <b>love</b> and that he never wanted his <b>adventure</b> with her to end.
                He wanted it to only be <b>beginning</b>.
                And though years had gone by in between, those two facts remained the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                So <b>Ryan</b> asked <b>Amy</b> to marry him, and <b>Amy</b> said "Yes" and now they're planning an awesome <b>wedding</b>.
                Building out their <b>website</b> because they want their friends to help them celebrate.
                And speaking of <b>friends</b> and helping celebrate, <b>Ryan</b> had recruited a whole pile of them to surprise <b>Amy</b> on their way down from
                <b>Clouds Rest</b>. The proposal.. well she saw that coming.. but the <b>ambush</b> was a surprise!!
            </p>

            <p>
                The rest of their <b>story</b> is tbd. Expect <b>no end</b> to more <b>mountains</b>, more <b>laughing</b> and more <b>love</b>.
                Beyond that, well.. no one can say for sure what happens next... but this <b>author</b> for one is quite <b>optimistic</b>!
