                Ah yes.. The story of <b>Amy</b> and <b>Ryan</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                How is it that two young <b>Googlers</b> find themselves creating such a site as this?
                Is this a <b>scandal</b>???

        <div class="solid-pane">
            <p>
                It all began in <b>2021</b>.
                <b>Amy</b> was a Software Engineer for <b>Chrome Browser</b> when <b>Ryan</b>
                joined Google to work on <b>ChromeOS</b>.
                They were each working on the compilers used in their respective product areas and
                so their desks were in the same corner of Google's <b>Sunnyvale</b> office.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was back when working from the <b>office</b> was an optional behavior due to covid measures
                and not very many people were coming in on any given day.
                <b>Amy</b> and <b>Ryan</b> came in nearly every day though, and would often get <b>lunch</b>
                together with a handful of other teammates.
                Though they didn't tell each other this at the time, they would someday both admit that
                one of the biggest reasons they would go in to the office so consistently was out of hope that
                the other would be there too.
                You see, Amy and Ryan very much enjoy each other's company.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soon, in addition to <b>lunch</b> in the office, their friendship expanded to include
                <b>climbing</b> at the local <b>climbing gym</b>.
            </p>

        <br>

        <div class="solid-pane">
            <p>
                <b>Ryan</b> pretty much had a crush on <b>Amy</b> from day one,
                but he didn't know if he should say it.
                Eventually though their <b>friendship</b> developed further when they started going on
                <b>hikes</b> together and climbing <b>outdoors</b>.
            </p>

        <div class="solid-pane">
            <p>
                Finally, in February 2022, <b>Ryan</b> decided to test his luck and invited <b>Amy</b> 
                to join him on a <b>snowshoe</b> backpacking trip up <b>El Capitan</b> in <b>Yosemite</b>.
                She was excited to join and they had a great time <b>hiking</b> through the snow and
                setting up <b>camp</b>.
            </p>

        <div class="solid-pane">
            <p>
                Though that <b>weekend</b> they were still just friends, they would begin <b>dating</b>
                within the very same week, and more <b>adventures</b> were soon to follow...
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Various trip photos, half dome, etc.-->

        <br>
        <div class="solid-pane">
            <p>
                In the time that's elapsed since that first trip, <b>Amy</b> and <b>Ryan</b>
                have been very <b>happy</b> together and their <b>love</b> for each other has continued to grow.
            </p>

        <br>

        <!-- Photo of us looking happy and in love-->

        <div class="solid-pane">
            <p>
                In the <b>summer</b> of 2024, <b>Ryan</b> began to plan a <b>proposal</b>.
                Several options were considered, but always <b>Ryan</b> was drawn to the idea of bringing
                it back to <b>Yosemite</b> where it all began.
            </p>
            <p>
                On August 10th, <b>Amy</b> and <b>Ryan</b> hiked from <b>Tenaya Lake</b> to <b>Clouds Rest</b>.
                <b>Ryan</b> was unusually <b>nervous</b>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <!-- Hiking up clouds rest photo-->
        <div id="gallery_7" class="photo-gallery"></div>

        <br>
        <div class="solid-pane">
            <p>
                The top of <b>Clouds Rest</b> has the most perfect <b>360-panoramic</b> view <b>Ryan</b> knows of.
                You can look down and see almost all of <b>Yosemite Valley</b> below.
                From there, the (in)famous peak of <b>Half Dome</b>, where <b>Amy</b> and <b>Ryan</b> have
                enjoyed several hard earned meals, can be seen some <b>1000 feet</b> below for an
                unusual change of perspective.
                To the North East you can see <b>Cathedral Peaks</b> and others landmarks where <b>Ryan</b>
                and <b>Amy</b> have gone hiking or backpacking.
                And on the edge of the <b>horizon</b>, just barely in sight, you can faintly identify the
                <b>unmistakable</b> surface of <b>El Capitan</b> itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the top of Clouds Rest, <b>Ryan</b> pointed out El Capitan to <b>Amy</b>.
                He told her that at the time when they had there <b>together</b>, two and a half year before, 
                fumbling through the snow and laughing..
                that being there with her had been by far the best thing he had ever done.
                And that's because while they were out there, backpacking together for the first time,
                <b>Ryan</b> realized without a doubt both
                1) that he was hopelessly in <b>love</b> with her and
                2) that he would never be ready for his <b>adventure</b> with her to end.
                That he wanted it to only just barely be <b>beginning</b>.
                And that although years had gone by in between, those two facts remained unchanged.
            </p>
            <p>
                So <b>Ryan</b> asked <b>Amy</b> to marry him, and <b>Amy</b> said "Yes" and now they're planning
                an awesome <b>wedding</b>.
                They are hard at work on little tasks, like building out a
                <b>website</b> to prepare because they want their friends and family to help them celebrate.
                And speaking of <b>friends</b> and helping celebrate, <b>Ryan</b> recruited a whole pile of them
                to surprise <b>Amy</b> on their way down from <b>Clouds Rest</b>.
                The proposal.. well she saw that coming.. but the <b>ambush</b> was a surprise!!

        <br>
        <div class="solid-pane">
            <p>
                The rest of their <b>story</b> is still to be decided.
                Expect <b>no end</b> to more <b>mountains</b>, more <b>laughing</b> and more <b>love</b>.
                Beyond that though, well.. no one can say for sure what happens next...
                but this <b>author</b> for one is quite content to be <b>optimistic</b>.
